## My First Desktop Application Built with Rust and Slint
After dedicating the past four months to studying the Rust programming language seriously, I found it challenging but remained determined to complete the course. I read the Rust Language Book and watched YouTube tutorials for a total of 14 hours to study and review. However, I typically spent no more than 30 minutes per day—or even less—because I needed time to practice the exercises provided by the instructor.

It took me about a month to finish the YouTube course. One particular tutorial stood out—it was exceptionally well-taught, paced slowly, and never felt rushed. The explanations were so detailed that anything unclear from the book became much easier to understand after watching the video.
